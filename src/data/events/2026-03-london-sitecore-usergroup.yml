    title: "MACH Is Complicated. Now SitecoreAI Makes It Work: Welcome to the Era of Content Operation Systems"
    description: Composable architectures promised flexibility, but many organisations now find themselves managing a sprawling MACH landscape with disconnected tools, fragile integrations and manual processes spread across systems. This session digs into why traditional composable stacks often fail at scale and why simply connecting APIs isn’t enough. The session will look at how enterprise needs have shifted beyond isolated categories like CMS, DAM or personalisation into holistic content operations, where workflows span every system and every team. Modern platforms like SitecoreAI are now blurring these lines, signaling that traditional analyst categories like Gartner’s Magic Quadrants may no longer fully represent how teams actually work.
