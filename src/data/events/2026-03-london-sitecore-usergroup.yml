intro: >
  <p><strong>The planning for our first user group of 2026 is underway, for an event near Paddington on the 19th of March.</strong></p>
  <p>So while we're working on getting the details of the event sorted, we're looking for some speakers. Could one of them be you?</p>
  <p>There will be two or three 20-30 minute talks during the evening. They can be on any topic that's related to Sitecore and its products. You could talk about things like:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>your experiences being a user</li>
  <li>building with their technology</li>
  <li>successes you've had on a project</li>
  <li>running your business strategy or personalisation</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>or anything else you can think of with a Sitecore slant.</p>
